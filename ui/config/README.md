The webpack configs and other files in this dir were initially created using

https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app

and then "ejected" and customized.

They are still similar enough to the original create-react-app configs to allow for comparison with the latest version of create-react-app, and
to allow the latest create-react-app bug fixes and changes to be ported over to the seqr build.
